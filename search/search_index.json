It has a scheduler to manage user created tasks.\nFreeRTOS provides APIs for users to control, \nsynchronize and communicate among various tasks.\n\n\n\n\n1.1. Features\n\n\nFreeRTOS supports the following five features to accomplish event/task\nscheduling and multitasking:\n\n\n\n\nTask and Scheduler. Each application consists of tasks or threads controlled by the operating system. The multitasking operation is implemented with a scheduler. The scheduler is in the kernel and manages the task execution at a specific time. The kernel can suspend and resume a task many times during lifecycle of the task execution.\n\n\nQueue. Queues are the primary forms of inter-task communications. \nIn most cases they are used as thread safe first-in-first-out (FIFO) buffers.\n\n\nSemaphore. Threads use semaphores to control the access to shared resources.\n\n\nSoftware Timer. A software timer allows a function to be invoked at a predefined time.\n\n\nThe timer callback functions are executed within the timer service task. It is essential to ensure the timer callback functions perform lightweight operations and return as quick as possible to avoid blocking the system resources.\n\n\nEvent Group (enabled after FreeRTOS version 8.0.0). An event group is a set of event bits. Individual event bits within an event group are referenced by a bit number. Event bits are used to indicate if an event has already occurred or not. Event groups can also be used to synchronize tasks.\n\n\nFor more information on FreeRTOS and its features, please refer to the official website.\n\n\n\n\n1.2. Heap service\n\n\nheap_4.c is used as the heap service on the SDK. More details can be found in the header file Source\\portable\n\n\n2.

It provides \nspecifications on how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed and received at the destination. The current IoT standard is moving towards IP communication and transporting data over various physical layers such as Wi-Fi, IEEE 802.15.4 and Bluetooth.\n\n\n\n\n2.1. Features\n\n\nlwIP is a widely used open source TCP/IP stack designed for embedded systems. \nIt includes the IP, ICMP, TCP, UDP, IGMP, ARP, AutoIP, DHCP, DNS and SNMP protocols.\n The SDK provides the following supported features for these protocols.\n\n\n\n\nIPv4\n (LWIP_IPV4).\n\n\nUDP (LWIP_UDP): User Datagram Protocol, the widely adopted connectionless transmission protocol.\n\n\nTCP (LWIP_TCP): Transmission Control Protocol, a widely used transport protocol providing reliable and in-order delivery.\n\n\nARP\n (LWIP_ARP).\n\n\nICMP\n (LWIP_ICMP).\n\n\nDHCP\n (LWIP_DHCP).\n\n\nDNS\n (LWIP_DNS).\n\n\nNETCONN\n (LWIP_NETCONN).\n\n\nSocket\n (LWIP_SOCKET).\n\n\n\n\n2.2. Memory usage\n\n\nThe MEM_SIZE parameter defines the size of the heap memory, PBUF_RAM, stores the sent and \nreceived data. If the application requires more data to send, the value of the parameter must be set higher.\nThe values of different control blocks are configurable in lwIP. For example, MEMP_NUM_NETDB\nsets the concurrent Domain Name Resolution connections. Below table lists the current configuration \nvalues of these blocks in the SDK. These pools are configured and allocated from a buffer reserved \nonly for the lwIP. The values are set to pass internal performance test and are expected to\nfulfill most common use cases. However, the number of configured control blocks could limit the maximum concurrent connections created by the network applications in the system, developers can configure these values for a specific use case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nCurrent_value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMEMP_NUM_UDP_PCB\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMEMP_NUM_TCP_PCB\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMEMP_NUM_TCP_PCB_LISTEN\n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMEMP_NUM_TCP_SEB\n\n\n255\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMEMP_NUM_REASSDATA\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMEMP_NUM_NETBUF\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMEMP_NUM_NETCONN\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMEMP_NUM_TCPIP_MSG_API\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMEMP_NUM_TCPIP_MSG_INPKT\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMEMP_NUM_SYS_TIMEOUT\n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMEMP_NUM_NETDB\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMEMP_NUM_PBUF\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPBUF_POOL_SIZE\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe required code size of lwIP is listed in Table.

TLS and SSL use X.509 certificates and asymmetric cryptography to authenticate secure data communication and to negotiate the process with a symmetric session key that ensure message confidentiality.\n\n\n\n\nmbed TLS\n offers libraries including SSL/TLS cryptographic communication capabilities for (embedded) devices and applications that provide end-to-end communication protection to the upper layer application protocols such as web browsing, email, instant messaging and voice-over-IP (VoIP).\n\n\nStarting from the version 2.1.0, mbed TLS is released under Apache 2.0 License and enables developers to use mbed TLS in both open source and closed source projects. \n\n\n3.1. Features\n\n\nmbed TLS\n  is an open source and commercial SSL library licensed under ARM Limited. This library easily integrates with new and existing (embedded) devices and applications and provides the building blocks for secure communication, cryptography and key management. Both the client-side and the server-side APIs support current SSL and TLS standards: SSL version 3.0, TLS version 1.0, TLS version 1.1 and TLS version 1.2. The cryptographic algorithms enabled in the SDK include:\n\n\n\n\n1) Symmetric encryption algorithms: AES, Triple-DES (3DES), DES, ARC4.\n\n\n2) Modes of operations: Cipher Block Chaining Mode (CBC).\n\n\n3) Hash algorithms: MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256.\n\n\n4) RSA/PKCS#1 v1.5.\n\n\n5) Random number generation: CTR_DRBG. \n\n\n\n\n3.2.

HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.\n\n\nHypertext is a structured text that uses logical links (hyperlinks) between nodes containing text. HTTP is the protocol to exchange or transfer hypertext.\n\n\nHTTP/1.1 is the most commonly used version of HTTP and was defined by \nRFC 2616\n in 1999.\n\n\n4.1. Features\n\n\nHTTPClient implements the client-side of HTTP/1.1. It provides base interfaces to send HTTP requests and receive HTTP responses from a resource identified by a URI. It also supports HTTPS (HTTP over SSL/TLS) to provide secure communication.\n\n\n4.2.

HTTP methods, status codes and semantics are the same and it should be possible to use the same APIs as HTTP/1.x (possibly with some small additions) to represent the protocol.\n\n\nThe focus of the protocol is on performance; specifically, end-user perceived latency, network and server resource usage. One major goal is to allow the use of a single connection from browsers to a website.\n\n\nThe basis of the work was SPDY, but HTTP/2 has evolved to take the community\u2019s input into account, incorporating several improvements in the process.\n\n\n5.1. Features\n\n\nThe framing layer of HTTP/2 is implemented as a reusable C library. On top of that, the SDK includes implementations of an HTTP/2 client, server, proxy, load test and bench marking tools for HTTP/2 and SPDY.\n\n\nAn HPACK encoder and decoder are available as public APIs.\n\n\nAn experimental high level C++ library is also available.\n\n\nIt only enables below features:\n\n\n\n\nThe C library of the HTTP/2 framing layer.\n\n\nHPACK encoder and decoder.\n\n\n\n\n5.2.

Each application consists of tasks or threads controlled by the operating system. The multitasking operation is implemented with a scheduler. The scheduler is in the kernel and manages the task execution at a specific time. The kernel can suspend and resume a task many times during lifecycle of the task execution.  Queue. Queues are the primary forms of inter-task communications. \nIn most cases they are used as thread safe first-in-first-out (FIFO) buffers.  Semaphore. Threads use semaphores to control the access to shared resources.  Software Timer. A software timer allows a function to be invoked at a predefined time.  The timer callback functions are executed within the timer service task. It is essential to ensure the timer callback functions perform lightweight operations and return as quick as possible to avoid blocking the system resources.  Event Group (enabled after FreeRTOS version 8.0.0). An event group is a set of event bits. Individual event bits within an event group are referenced by a bit number. Event bits are used to indicate if an event has already occurred or not. Event groups can also be used to synchronize tasks.
